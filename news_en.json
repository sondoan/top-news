During checks on 375 workers, three were arrested, and investigations are underway for both the illegal workers and locals who facilitated them. Penalties for illegal work can include fines up to SGD20,000 and two years imprisonment.\n\nDelivery companies like Deliveroo and Grab state they combat illegal employment and account sharing through measures like selfie verification. However, instances of account rental for illegal work still appear online. Last year, around 90 complaints about suspected illegal foreign delivery drivers were investigated, indicating an ongoing challenge despite efforts from authorities and companies.",

Key factors driving this struggle include soaring operating costs like rising rents, ingredient prices, and manpower expenses.\n\nAdditionally, changing consumer habits contribute to the downturn; Singaporeans are increasingly traveling abroad for cheaper dining options, while many are cutting back on local dining out due to economic pressures. Manpower shortages and strict foreign worker policies further compound difficulties.\n\nDespite concerns that this trend could erode Singapore's culinary heritage, some promise remains. Growth drivers include rising tourism, new F&B establishments in mixed developments, and landlords adapting spaces. Operators are also streamlining operations, innovating concepts, and adopting technology to adapt and push for continued growth.",
